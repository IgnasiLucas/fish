    Nreads = total number of reads for a sample
    passed = retained reads that passed quality filtering at full length
    passed.w.trim= retained reads that were trimmed due to detection of adapters
    passed.total  = total kept reads of sufficient length
    note: you can set the option in params file to include trimmed reads of xx length.
